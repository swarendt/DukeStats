## Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

The BRFSS is a collection of health related telephone surveys conducted annually.  The BRFSS boasts an annual collection of 400,000 surveys performed each year on a wide variety of health issues and risk behaviors on adult U.S. residents.  The data is collected from all 50 states along with the District of Columbia.

The data can be found online at CDC website.  I am using the 2013 set of data for this analysis.

Percentage of US Adults who reported Fair or poor health
https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/brfss.htm

## Initial setup requirements

Set the enivronments, load all of the necessary libraries and load the full data set.

```{r set-environment, message=FALSE}
setwd('C:/Development/R Projects/Duke/IntroProbData/Course Project')

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)

load("brfss2013.RData")
```

## Part 1: Data

The 2013 survey contains a collection of 491775 respondents with 330 facts.  

* * *

## Part 2: Research questions

**Question 1: Does the amount of sleep have any correlation to the general feeling of wellness?**

**Question 2: Are there any correlations between income and receiving flu shots?**

**Question 3: Given that a random survey respondent is a woman, what is the percentage that the respondent smokes?**

## Exploratory data analysis 

**Research question 1:**

This survey includes a question about how the respondents feel in general.  I wondered if there is any relationship between getting a good night's sleep and how people responded about their health.  For this question, I did some research and found that the National Sleep Foundation recommends that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night.  This is what I will call "a good night's sleep" for my research.

The first thing that I am doing is creating a clean data set of just two facts: the general health status and the sleep time.  I am cleaning the data by removing all records that have NA for either column.  I am also removing all records that have a sleep time greater than 24 (there were 2).  These have been removed because they are obviously erroneous.  It also seems implausible that records with 0 or 24 hours daily are valid, but I do not have enough information to make a determination on them.  I am choosing to leave them in my data set.

```{r}
sleepANDhealth <-
  brfss2013 %>%
    filter(!is.na(genhlth)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(sleptim1)) %>%
    filter(sleptim1 <= 24) %>%
    select(genhlth, sleptim1)
```

Running some functions on the sleep time provides us with a median of 7, mean of 7.051 and standard deviation of 1.464587.

```{r}
summary(sleepANDhealth$sleptim1)
sd(sleepANDhealth$sleptim1)
```

Plotting a histogram of the sleep time provides a nearly normal distribution, that is slightly skewed right.

```{r q1histogram}
hist(sleepANDhealth$sleptim1, main = "Histogram of Sleep Time", xlab = "Sleep Time (in hours)")
```

The National sleep foundation recommends that adults get between 7 and 9 hours of sleep each day.

Looking over the histogram of sleep times from the survey respondents, I can see that it matches up with the recommendation from the National Sleep Foundation.  Because of this, I am going to create categories for the sleep time as follows (roughly based on the average and the standard deviation):

Hours of Sleep | Category
-------------- | -------------
0 through 4 | Significantly sleep deprived
5 and 6 | Sleep deprived
7 through 9 | Average sleep
10 and 11 | Oversleeping
12 through 24 | Significant oversleeping

```{r q1categories}
levels <- c(-Inf, 5, 6.8, 9.8, 11.8, Inf)
labels <- c("Significantly Sleep Deprived", "Sleep Deprived", "Average", "Oversleeping", "Significant Oversleeping")

sleepANDhealth <- sleepANDhealth %>% 
  mutate(sleepcat = cut(sleptim1, levels, labels = labels))
```


```{r q1results}
table(sleepANDhealth$sleepcat)
plot(sleepANDhealth$sleepcat, sleepANDhealth$genhlth, xlab = "Sleep Category", ylab = "Feeling of Health")
```

Conclusions for question 1. Based on the chart above, there does appear to be a correlation between sleep times and the general feeling of health.  As you can see, the Average category (which is the recommending sleep times) has the highest amount of people who rated themselves in good health or better.  As people had more or less sleep than recommended, they were more likely to rate themselves as fair or poor health.

What cannot be concluded here is whether getting the recommended sleep improves health or if better health improves sleep times.  It is cannot be concluded whether there is another factor that affects both.

**Research question 2:**

Does income influence whether someone will get a flu shot?

There are common perceptions that people with higher incomes have more access to health care.  Does the survey support this assumption when it comes to a preventitive flu shot?

Let's start by doing some analysis on incomes in order to better understand our data set.  The INCOME2 column contains a factor variable that already categorizes the survey taker into 8 bins.  I will the factor levels that they have provided and filter out any responders with the values missing.  

FLUSHOT6

```{r q2income}
incomeANDflu <-
  brfss2013 %>%
    filter(!is.na(income2)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(flushot6)) %>%
    filter(flushot6 == 'Yes' | flushot6 == 'No') %>%
    select(income2, flushot6)

summary(incomeANDflu$income2)
summary(incomeANDflu$flushot6)

incomeANDflugroups <-
  incomeANDflu %>%
      filter() %>%
      group_by(income2, flushot6) %>% 
      summarise(count = n())

```


```{r q2pivot}

incomeANDflugroups <- dcast(incomeANDflugroups, income2 ~ flushot6, value.var = "count")
incomeANDflugroups <- incomeANDflugroups %>%
  mutate(yespercent = Yes / (Yes + No))
incomeANDflugroups
```


```{r q2plot}
ggplot(data=incomeANDflugroups, aes(x=income2, y=yespercent)) +
        ggtitle("Flu Shots Based on Income") +
        labs(x="Income Category",y="Percent Receiving Flu Shots") +  
        theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face="bold", color="#0000FF", size=10, angle=45)) +
        geom_bar(colour="black", fill="#FF0000", stat="identity");
```

**Research question 3:**

If I choose a random survey respondent who smokes, what is the probability of the respondent being a female?

I will create another new data set for my data analysis.  I am going to remove all records that do not have the gender selected (this removes 7 records).  Determining whether someone is a smoker and that we have valid data is a little more complicated.  The SMOKE100 column indicates whether someone has smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.  Values other than 1 or 2 have no meaning in my analysis and so I will filter them out.

The data related to smoking is a little bit confusing.  So I am outlining the decisions that I have made on how to interpret the data.

smoke100 | smokday2 | Smoker 
-------------- | ------------- | -------------
7, 9 and NA | Any Value | Can't determine, these will be discarded
2 | Any value | Not a smoker
1 | 7, 9 and NA | Can't determine, these will be discarded
1 | 3 | No, these are former smokers.
1 | 1 and 2 | Yes

Once these filters are in place, we are left with a total of 476442 records.

```{r q3filtering}

genderANDsmoking <-
  brfss2013 %>%
    filter(!is.na(sex)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(smoke100)) %>%
    filter(smoke100 == 'Yes' & !is.na(smokday2) | smoke100 == 'No') %>%
    select(sex, smoke100, smokday2)

genderANDsmoking <- genderANDsmoking %>%
    mutate(smoker = smoke100 == 'Yes' & smokday2 %in% c('Every day','Some days'))

genderANDsmoking %>%
    filter() %>%
    group_by(sex, smoke100, smokday2, smoker) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())
```

Now that I have a clean dataset, with the identification of smoking status in the new smoker column, I can do some analysis on the dataset.  

```{r q3summaries}
genderANDsmoking %>%
    filter() %>%
    group_by(sex) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())

genderANDsmoking %>%
    filter() %>%
    group_by(sex, smoker) %>% 
    summarise(count = n())
```

To help determine the answer, I decided to use a probability tree and have inserted my drawing of the tree here.
